# WFC-Gen

Wave Function Collapse in Haxe/OpenFL. 

Originally I decided to write this for learning purposes so there may be some implementation details that differ from the original as well as improvements that could be made.

Examples of what this is and does can be found at the original link: https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

To anyone that wants to try implementing it themselves, I highly recommend reading the original [page](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), this [research paper](https://adamsmith.as/papers/wfc_is_constraint_solving_in_the_wild.pdf) by Isaac Karth and Adam M. Smith, and this [blog post](https://trasevol.dog/2017/09/01/di19/).

Thanks to Isaac Karth as well for shedding light on some of the finer details, tips on debugging, and suggestions whenever I got stuck.
